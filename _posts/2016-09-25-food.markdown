So apparently I get myself involved in things solely for the free food.
<br/><br/>
Like literally my only incentive is food.
<br/><br/>
That and the fact that I might be doing something productive (mostly food though)
<br/><br/>
In fact if there's like a crappy math conference with free food, I'd probably go.
<br/><br/>
Unless the food is just pizza, in that case, it's not worth it (pizza is worth a lot, but not math)
