First, Happy New Year (even though that was last month).
<br>
Second, I would like to address the fact that I had to actually Google (as in the verb, because that's a thing now) "a while vs. awhile" because I'm a nerd.
<br>
Third, I TAKE IT BACK BTS - FIRE IS LITERALLY LIT. Like at first I was like, nah this is overhyped and eh, but like BS&T came out and I was like, might as well give Fire another listen though, so I DID AND IT WAS GREAT. ALSO BS&T'S INSTRUMENTAL IS FRICKIN ON POINT. AND FIRE'S INSTRUMENTAL. ALSO SAVE ME AND RUN'S INSTRUMENTAL. But that's a given. Basically I re-discovered BTS and watched a bunch of their variety shows and stuff lol call me trash.
<br>
Okay so in terms of kpop news, all in all it was a pretty rocky few weeks.
<br>
Like. *Real rocky*.
<br>
My girls 2NE1 disbanded, and I like literally almost cried. Goodbye was a good song, thought Dara got like, what, two lines?
<br>
So with the whole disbandment thing, 4Minute (which, not sure if I mentioned this before, but I got super into Crazy and Hate and Volume Up and a few of their other songs), Wonder Girls (Why So Lonely was a solid song), Spica (though I never really knew any of their songs), KARA (although this happened quite a while ago), and Rainbow (never really got into them, but Hyunyoung was in Boarding House No.24) all disbanded. Which is sad. Like on the internet, everyone's just going on about the end of the 2nd generation of kpop.
<br>
People are saying Miss A is going to be disbanding, which sucks.
<br>
Afterschool is still not gonna comeback (according to Pledis, they're going to focus on individual activities) which is worrisome because Nu'est is also Pledis.
<br>
Seventeen actually has *really* catchy songs. Like. Really. Catchy. Very Nice. Boom song reference boom. *high-fives self for the double reference*
<br>
Rania is basically super weird right now. Like. BP Rania right? But like Alex is not even. On the stage? Although I think they said something about an injury. And Yumin has like. Zero lines. Literally. Not even exaggerating. Like, in the live performances, she gets one line, but recorded she has none. Also what's this about Alex being the leader? I'm still pretty sure she can't really speak Korean too well, and she's barely on the stage, so uh? Dr.Music? What are we thinking?
<br>
SO YOOJIN AND HYERAN APPARENTLY LEFT BRAVE GIRLS? Not sure about Hyeran (it might be hiatus), but that means original Brave Girls is basically gone.
<br>
OKAY SO FOR THE GOOD KPOP NEWS:
<br>
First. VIXX - CLOSER (this was several months ago but still, I haven't addressed it yet so). LOVE THE SONG.
<br>
VIXX - MILKY WAY. ALSO LOVE IT. Apparently Ravi and Hyuk wrote the lyrics. Not sure if I'm impressed, as I don't actually understand the lyrics. But. <del>Still impressed.</del>
<br>
Ok so also Hyuk released this special... um... something? Idk it's a song that he wrote and stuff apparently called Hug Me (I think) and it's super good. Like. I didn't know Hyuk had gotten that good at singing.
<br>
Ravi released Bomb. Which admittedly at first I was kinda eh about it, but it has grown on me. In other words, I like it.
<br>
I feel the need to address Blood Sweat and Tears again, because I honestly did not like it at all at first. I feel like this is the case for me with a lot of BTS songs. Like Dope. And Fire. Both songs that I was icky about at first, but now love. I play them on repeat sometimes. It's great. Anyway, BS&T has a really addicting instrumental, and while the vocals are kinda, too airy for me(?), the instrumental totally makes up for it and I admit. I did play it on repeat a few times. Less that Vixx - Fantasy and Infinite - The Eye. But still, I did.
<br>
GOT7 - Hard Carry. What's there to say? It hard carried. Loved it. Some awkward misheard lyrics here and there. But loved it. People say it's a BTS knock-off. Certainly is similar in style to Fire, but wouldn't go as far as to say knock-off. Plus, that's not how knock-offs work (i'm looking at you turkish guy *coughvixxdynamitecough*)
<br>
Blackpink released Playing With Fire and Stay. Never really got into Stay, but bop to Playing with Fire all the time lol. Jk. <del>I'm not joking</del>
