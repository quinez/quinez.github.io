First, Happy New Year (even though that was last month)!
<br><br>
Second, I would like to address the fact that I had to actually Google (as in the verb, because that's a thing now) "a while vs. awhile" because I'm a nerd.
<br><br>
Third, I TAKE IT BACK BTS - FIRE IS LITERALLY LIT. Like at first I was like, nah this is overhyped and eh, but like BS&T came out and I was like, might as well give Fire another listen though, so I DID AND IT WAS GREAT. ALSO BS&T'S INSTRUMENTAL IS FRICKIN ON POINT. AND FIRE'S INSTRUMENTAL. ALSO SAVE ME AND RUN'S INSTRUMENTAL. But that's a given. Basically I re-discovered BTS and watched a bunch of their variety shows and stuff lol call me trash.
<br><br>
Okay so in terms of kpop news, all in all it was a pretty rocky few weeks.
<br><br>
Like. *Real rocky*.
<br><br>
My girls 2NE1 disbanded, and I like literally almost cried. Goodbye was a good song, thought Dara got like, what, two lines?
<br><br>
So with the whole disbandment thing, 4Minute (which, not sure if I mentioned this before, but I got super into Crazy and Hate and Volume Up and a few of their other songs), Wonder Girls (Why So Lonely was a solid song), Spica (though I never really knew any of their songs), KARA (although this happened quite a while ago), and Rainbow (never really got into them, but Hyunyoung was in Boarding House No.24) all disbanded. Which is sad. Like on the internet, everyone's just going on about the end of the 2nd generation of kpop.
<br><br>
People are saying Miss A is going to be disbanding, which sucks.
<br><br>
Afterschool is still not gonna comeback (according to Pledis, they're going to focus on individual activities) which is worrisome because Nu'est is also Pledis.
<br><br>
Seventeen actually has *really* catchy songs. Like. Really. Catchy. Very Nice. Boom song reference boom. *high-fives self for the double reference*
<br><br>
Rania is basically super weird right now. Like. BP Rania right? But like Alex is not even. On the stage? Although I think they said something about an injury. And Yumin has like. Zero lines. Literally. Not even exaggerating. Like, in the live performances, she gets one line, but recorded she has none. Also what's this about Alex being the leader? I'm still pretty sure she can't really speak <del>k</del>Korean too well, and she's barely on the stage, so uh? Dr.Music? What are we thinking?
<br><br>
SO YOOJIN AND HYERAN APPARENTLY LEFT BRAVE GIRLS? Not sure about Hyeran (it might be hiatus), but that means original Brave Girls is basically gone.
<br><br>
OKAY SO FOR THE GOOD KPOP NEWS:
<br><br>
First. VIXX - CLOSER (this was several months ago but still, I haven't addressed it yet so). LOVE THE SONG. I love the instrumental, and the beat, and the song in general tbh. Especially the beginning. Like it starts super laid-back, but get more intense at the chorus and it's great. At first, I was like. Wait. This is VIXX? But then in came the Chorus. All the other songs in the (mini-?)album were super good too by the way. Like. Listen to em all. ALL OF THEM. ON REPEAT. Lol.
<br><br>
VIXX - MILKY WAY. ALSO LOVE IT. Apparently Ravi and Hyuk wrote the lyrics. Not sure if I'm impressed, as I don't actually understand the lyrics. But. <del>Still impressed.</del>
<br><br>
Ok so also Hyuk released this special... um... something? Idk it's a song that he wrote and stuff apparently called Hug Me (I think) and it's super good. Like. I didn't know Hyuk had gotten that good at singing.
<br><br>
Ravi released Bomb. Which admittedly at first I was kinda eh about it, but it has grown on me. In other words, I like it.
<br><br>
I feel the need to address Blood Sweat and Tears again, because I honestly did not like it at all at first. I feel like this is the case for me with a lot of BTS songs. Like Dope. And Fire. Both songs that I was icky about at first, but now love. I play them on repeat sometimes. It's great. Anyway, BS&T has a really addicting instrumental, and while the vocals are kinda, too airy for me(?), the instrumental totally makes up for it and I admit. I did play it on repeat a few times. Less that Vixx - Fantasy and Infinite - The Eye. But still, I did.
<br><br>
GOT7 - Hard Carry. What's there to say? It hard carried. Loved it. Some awkward misheard lyrics here and there. But loved it. People say it's a BTS knock-off. Certainly is similar in style to Fire, but wouldn't go as far as to say knock-off. Plus, that's not how knock-offs work (i'm looking at you turkish guy *coughvixxdynamitecough*)
<br><br>
Blackpink released Playing With Fire and Stay. Never really got into Stay, but bop to Playing with Fire all the time lol. Jk. <del>I'm not joking</del>
<br><br>
Astro - Confession. Not a big deal. Kinda the same sound as their previous two title tracks. It's good, but not super note-worthy. Although it's catchy.
<br><br>
Mamamoo released Decalcomanie, which is a 270 degree turn from their previous concepts. It's a good song though. A little too airy for me though. Kinda like how I feel BS&T except rather than the instrumental, I like the melody.
<br><br>
Jung Joonyoung (omg) came back! Whoot! After his whole sexual abuse scandal (I think that's what it was) he releases a solid track that I BY THE WAY HAVE ONLY LISTENED TO ONCE, BUT WILL LISTEN TO AGAIN LIKE TWENTY TIMES. IT'S CALLED ME AND YOU, WATCH IT EVERYONE.
<br><br>
Sistar - One More Day. Is a good song. They didn't promote it, I don't think, which sucks because it was a legit solid song. The lesbian themes in the m/v were also pretty cool because Korea's pretty well-known for being. Well. Homophobic.
<br><br>
I actually almost forgot to mention Kard - Oh Nana. It's a good song. Check it out. Be warned though, it's really catchy and addicting. Love the instrumental.
<br><br>
So Infinite, nothing new yet. But I discovered some of their previous non-title songs, like 1/3 <del>(which btw hits me right in the woogyu kokoro lol jk)</del>, and Julia (I still don't understand the A I O I thing). I also feel the need to address the fact that Paradise is frickin stuck in my head ALL THE TIME and it sucks and is great at the same time, because I love that song, but I really needed to focus on my math test so... 
<br><br>
So onto the real juice. Besides VIXX's comebacks (THE CLOSER ROCKED OMG, also milky way, but that wasn't a comeback I don't think), the one song release that I loved the most was Day6. FRICKIN. I Wait. (btw is the <del>k</del>Korean title really "a wae". Like. is that the transliteration of the English title. Or is that actually Korean?) Dude it's so good. It's like, a lot more rock-esque than their previous songs and that makes me squeal. For real I heard it and died. ALSO Day6 You Were Beautiful. I only listened to it once so far, but it's great. I love the beginning. I'm not a music/song person (I play an instrument but that's different), so idk what the parts are called, but yeah. Like. The leading-into-the-song instrumental part? That.
<br><br>
More from JYP ent: JUN.K's No Shadow and Your Wedding. I wasn't too big a fan of either at first but now I am. I played No Shadow on repeat for a good half hour. It was wild.
<br><br>
Ok this isn't good news:
<br><br>
So, I gotta be honest. I'm kind of worried. (mostly because at this point, I'm not trash anymore, I *am* the trashcan). Infinite's contracts are apparently expiring in a few months, and well, I love Infinite. They are life. Let's be honest they rock. Also Sunggyu said he's going to be going to the military soon? That's what I heard. There was this big deal about how he was going to leave for the military and Woohyun was going to take his place as leader, and while I'm pretty sure that's not what he meant when he said that he was the youngest of the family (like, the Infinite family or something? Don't quite remember) and that he would pass on his responsibilities to Woohyun, it could be foreshadowing. No. I don't want any shadows. (Jun.K reference self high-five)
<br><br>
Anyway I really, REALLY, hope that Infinite stays together and comes back this year, or goes on tour. Or something. Some activities to make sure they're still a thing, and haven't dropped from the surface of the earth like some other groups have. Although I guess their health and interests are more important. But like. As a giant fan, I wouldn't want for them to disband any time soon. Like maybe never. That would be cool. Jk. I'm not joking. Lol.
<br><br>
So what has been going on in my life? Nothing. Pissed off a couple of people. Pissed them off some more. Trying to fix it right now. Not really working. Give it some time though. Neighbour's car got hijacked apparently. Lady turned on her car, went back into the house to grab something, when she came back someone was driving her car away. Honestly, the guy couldn't possibly have planned this out though. How would he/she know that she was going to go back into the house? I mean, he was probably someone passing by and saw the car on and was like "oh don't mind if I do" and hightailed outta there. Also I worked for like. Two weeks. It was sad. It was a two-week term, though. I was not fired in two weeks or anything like that. That's basically it. I'm trying to re-start watching kdramas because someone I know watches them, but they're so frickin cheesy lol. I'm okay with the cliche, but man. It's cringy half the time. WHICH REMINDS ME RUNNING MAN IS NOT CANCELLED. LIFE! Lol.
<br><br>
Anyway that's it from me. See y'all next time!
<br><br>
Tl;dr bunches of kpop band disbanded or might be disbanding soon and it worries+saddens me, but also a bunch of newer bands had comebacks recently so that was a good thing. My neighbour's car was also robbed. Was hilarious. 
<br>
Also what happened to Girl's Day, are they coming back?
