"Would you tell me, please, which way I ought to walk from here?"
<br/>
"That depends a good deal on where you want to get to," said the Cat.
<br/>
"I don't much care where&mdash;" said Alice.
<br/>
"Then it doesn't matter which way you walk," said the Cat.
<br/>
"&mdash;so long as I get somewhere," Alice added as an explanation.
<br/>
"Oh you're sure to do that," said the Cat, "if you only walk long enough."
