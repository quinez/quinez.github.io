Did I mention I speak French?
<br/>
(No I'm not just a loser that puts French songs quotes that I don't understand to look cool and listens to French songs just to be multicultural and hip, I actually do understand the stuff)
<br/><br/>
(It's weird capitalizing languages because in <strike>f</strike>French you don't)
<br/><br/>
I also want to learn German and Swedish (hej! I'm sorry don't kill me), Spanish, Italian, Korean (obviously lol), Japanese, Chinese (I speak Mandarin but can't write or read Chinese), Greek, Latin (even though it's dead) etc. etc. etc. etc. You get my point. I just like the idea of speaking languages, but I never get to actually learning them.
