A bunch of things have happened (or rather haven't happened idk)
<br/><br/>
Summary because I'm lazy today: HARD CARRY - GOT7 came out which basically meant I died a few times listening to it. Also the weird cooking thing was kinda weird because fruit salad really? And that's all I can think of besides having applied for a ton of things that I honestly don't think I'll make, but I hope I do. Oh I also re-realised that I hate math. Also I played Spyfall for the first time and I am terrible at it. Thing that didn't happen: Japanese. Pretty unhappy about that but I got this weird coding class-ish thingy and that's pretty cool. I'm also trying to memorize the Korean alphabet-y thing. (I seriously gotta re-learn Python tho lol).

Tl;dr: My eventful week-ish.
