A bunch of things have happened (or rather haven't happened idk)
<br/><br/>
Summary because I'm lazy today: HARD CARRY - GOT7 came out which basically meant I died a few times listening to it. Also the weird cooking thing was kinda weird because fruit salad really? And that's all I can think of besides having applied for a ton of things that I honestly don't think I'll make, but I hope I do. Oh I also re-realised that I hate math. Also I played Spyfall for the first time and I am terrible at it.
<br/><br/>
Tl;dr: My eventful week-ish.
