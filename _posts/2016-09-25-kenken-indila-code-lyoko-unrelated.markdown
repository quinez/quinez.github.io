So I got (my friend) addicted to KenKen puzzles (surprising since I hate math with 90% of me<strike>, ironic percentages huh</strike>). It's pretty great.
<br/><br/>
I also found out that I'm also obsessed with Indila (dude I love her voice/songs) and Code Lyoko (it's not that bad I swear <strike>okay it is but still</strike>), and my mp3 player is running out of space right now and I have to compress all of my files and it's so tedious.
<br/><br/>
Curse me and my non-filtering taste for music (I used to be so picky).
