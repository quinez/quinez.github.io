Okkkkk so I'm pretty sure I said somewhere before that I didn't like BTS Spring Day because I didn't like it's instrumental/it's lack of catchy as frick instrumental and I think I wrote somewhere that I liked BTS's songs because of the catchy instrumentals? So yeah that's been bugging me for a while so I was like, wait... is this even true? So I went and listened to some BTS songs (I Need U, Run, and Boy in Luv) and... yup... no super catchy instrumental. I think it's just their newer somgs that have it (Dope, Fire, Save Me, BS&T). Anyway yeah so it took me a while, but I am now addicted to Spring Day and also the dance performance for it made me almost legit cry (okay not even close but it was great). Not Today is still kinda.... yeah the JK part... still can't get into that lol.
<br/><br/>
Okay but what's even going on with Got7 though? Like JYP? What is Never Ever? The mixing sounds kinda... bad? I mean that and the cheesy English lyrics makes me feel like I'm being rick rolled. Yeah, never gonna make you cry, (never gonna say goodbye sorrynotsorry).
<br/><br/>
Also English ver. Don't Recall - K.A.R.D? Kinda weird? But also kinda aesthetic?
<br/><br/>
However. Can I just. Infinite. When. Bro.

So I got free hot chocolate today though lol.
<br/>
